			<p>I am...Iron Man. Just kidding! My name is Ubonwan, which means Golden Lotus. It is pronouced the same way it is spelled: Oo-bon-wan. Despite what many people believe, I was actually not named after Obi-Wan Kenobi. Though, it would be cool if I was a legendary Jedi Master. <img src="assets/images/Obi-Wan.png" width="30"></p>

			<p>I am originally from Thailand; born in Bangkok and raised in Phichit, which is a small province positioned in the southern part of the northern region.</p>

			<p>I recently graduated with a Bachelor in Hospitality Management and have previously received an opportunity to work at Epcot and Disney's Beach Club Resort. The most exciting thing that happened to me there was that I met Hugh Jackman aka Wolverine. Up until today, I still can't shut up about that (he touched my shoulder!)<img src="assets/images/Wolverine Emoji.png" width="50"></p>
